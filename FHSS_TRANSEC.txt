Military radios generate a frequency-hopping pattern under the control of a secret Transmission Security Key (TRANSEC) that the sender and receiver share in advance. Using the SAMD51's TRNG (True Random Number Generator) propose a Frequency-hopping spread spectrum TRANSEC key system that allows Adafruit Metro M4 boards to generate and share TRANSEC keys over SPI, I2C, etc.

For creating a Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) TRANSEC key system using SAMD51's TRNG, you can use the following approach:

1. **Key Generation**: Each Adafruit Metro M4 board will use the SAMD51's TRNG to generate a secure random TRANSEC key. This key will be used as a seed for the frequency-hopping pattern.

2. **Key Exchange**: Before communication can start, both the sender and receiver must exchange and store the TRANSEC keys. For this purpose, we can use a key exchange protocol. One method could be using asymmetric encryption (like RSA) to securely exchange keys over an insecure channel (SPI, I2C, etc.).

3. **Frequency Hopping Pattern Generation**: Use the TRANSEC key as a seed for a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). This PRNG will generate a sequence of numbers which will be used as the hopping pattern. The same seed (TRANSEC key) will produce the same hopping pattern on both boards.

4. **Communication**: During communication, both sender and receiver will change frequencies according to the hopping pattern generated in step 3.

Here's a simplified overview of what the code could look like:

```cpp
#include <Adafruit_ZeroTimer.h>
#include <SPI.h> // or <Wire.h> for I2C

// Constants
#define KEY_LENGTH 256  // Length of TRANSEC key in bits

// Variables
uint8_t TRANSECKey[KEY_LENGTH/8];

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial); // wait for serial port to connect
  
  // Initialize TRNG
  MCLK->APBCMASK.bit.TRNG_ = 1;
  TRNG->CTRLA.bit.ENABLE = 1;

  // Generate TRANSEC key
  generateTRANSECKey();
  
  // Securely exchange TRANSEC keys with the other board
  // NOTE: This is a placeholder. Implementing secure key exchange
  //       typically involves using asymmetric encryption (like RSA).
  exchangeKeys();
  
  // Initialize communication hardware (SPI, I2C, etc.)
  // ...

  // Initialize timer for frequency hopping
  initTimer();
}

void loop() {
  // Communicate using the Frequency-hopping spread spectrum
}

void generateTRANSECKey() {
  for (int i = 0; i < KEY_LENGTH/8; i++) {
    TRANSECKey[i] = get_trng() & 0xFF;
  }
}

void exchangeKeys() {
  // Implement secure key exchange here
  // ...
}

void initTimer() {
  // Initialize a hardware timer that triggers frequency hopping
  // ...
}

uint32_t get_trng() {
  while ((TRNG->INTFLAG.reg & TRNG_INTFLAG_MASK) == 0);
  return (TRNG->DATA.reg);
}

void TimerHandler() {
  // Called periodically to change the frequency according to hopping pattern
  // ...
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and implementing secure communication is a complex task. In particular, the secure exchange of keys (in the `exchangeKeys` function) can be complex and should ideally be done with established cryptographic libraries and protocols.

List any remaining programs necessary to implement our Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) TRANSEC key system and suggest file names for each.

To fully implement a Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) TRANSEC key system, several additional programs/modules are necessary:

1. **Frequency Hopping Pattern Generator**: This program will use the TRANSEC key to generate a pseudorandom frequency hopping pattern. This is essential for the devices to know which frequencies to use at what times.

    Suggested file name: `FrequencyHoppingPatternGenerator.ino`

2. **RF Communication Module**: This is the program that will handle the actual communication over the airwaves. It should include functions to send and receive data packets, as well as change the transmission frequency according to the frequency hopping pattern.

    Suggested file name: `RFCommunicationModule.ino`

3. **Synchronization Module**: This program ensures that both the transmitter and receiver are in sync regarding the frequency hopping pattern. This might involve timestamping data packets and accounting for any delays.

    Suggested file name: `SynchronizationModule.ino`

4. **Error Handling Module**: This program handles any errors that might occur during data transmission, such as lost packets or interference. Techniques like Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) can be used.

    Suggested file name: `ErrorHandlingModule.ino`

5. **Encryption Module**: This program ensures that the data being sent is encrypted. While the TRANSEC key itself is a part of the encryption, the data payload also needs to be encrypted for additional security.

    Suggested file name: `EncryptionModule.ino`

6. **Device Authentication Module**: This program ensures that only authorized devices can communicate with each other by implementing an authentication process when they first establish a connection.

    Suggested file name: `DeviceAuthenticationModule.ino`

7. **User Interface**: Finally, there should be some user interface, either through serial communication or a physical interface (buttons and LCD), allowing the user to enter commands, view status, and control the system.

    Suggested file name: `UserInterface.ino`

Please note that in a real-world implementation, these modules would likely not be stand-alone programs but rather parts of a larger, integrated codebase. Furthermore, this kind of communication system should be developed with a thorough understanding of the legal and regulatory requirements for radio frequency communications in the relevant jurisdictions, as well as best practices for security.
