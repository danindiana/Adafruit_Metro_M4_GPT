Military radios generate a frequency-hopping pattern under the control of a secret Transmission Security Key (TRANSEC) that the sender and receiver share in advance. Using the SAMD51's TRNG (True Random Number Generator) propose a Frequency-hopping spread spectrum TRANSEC key system that allows Adafruit Metro M4 boards to generate and share TRANSEC keys over SPI, I2C, etc.

For creating a Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) TRANSEC key system using SAMD51's TRNG, you can use the following approach:

1. **Key Generation**: Each Adafruit Metro M4 board will use the SAMD51's TRNG to generate a secure random TRANSEC key. This key will be used as a seed for the frequency-hopping pattern.

2. **Key Exchange**: Before communication can start, both the sender and receiver must exchange and store the TRANSEC keys. For this purpose, we can use a key exchange protocol. One method could be using asymmetric encryption (like RSA) to securely exchange keys over an insecure channel (SPI, I2C, etc.).

3. **Frequency Hopping Pattern Generation**: Use the TRANSEC key as a seed for a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). This PRNG will generate a sequence of numbers which will be used as the hopping pattern. The same seed (TRANSEC key) will produce the same hopping pattern on both boards.

4. **Communication**: During communication, both sender and receiver will change frequencies according to the hopping pattern generated in step 3.

Here's a simplified overview of what the code could look like:

```cpp
#include <Adafruit_ZeroTimer.h>
#include <SPI.h> // or <Wire.h> for I2C

// Constants
#define KEY_LENGTH 256  // Length of TRANSEC key in bits

// Variables
uint8_t TRANSECKey[KEY_LENGTH/8];

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial); // wait for serial port to connect
  
  // Initialize TRNG
  MCLK->APBCMASK.bit.TRNG_ = 1;
  TRNG->CTRLA.bit.ENABLE = 1;

  // Generate TRANSEC key
  generateTRANSECKey();
  
  // Securely exchange TRANSEC keys with the other board
  // NOTE: This is a placeholder. Implementing secure key exchange
  //       typically involves using asymmetric encryption (like RSA).
  exchangeKeys();
  
  // Initialize communication hardware (SPI, I2C, etc.)
  // ...

  // Initialize timer for frequency hopping
  initTimer();
}

void loop() {
  // Communicate using the Frequency-hopping spread spectrum
}

void generateTRANSECKey() {
  for (int i = 0; i < KEY_LENGTH/8; i++) {
    TRANSECKey[i] = get_trng() & 0xFF;
  }
}

void exchangeKeys() {
  // Implement secure key exchange here
  // ...
}

void initTimer() {
  // Initialize a hardware timer that triggers frequency hopping
  // ...
}

uint32_t get_trng() {
  while ((TRNG->INTFLAG.reg & TRNG_INTFLAG_MASK) == 0);
  return (TRNG->DATA.reg);
}

void TimerHandler() {
  // Called periodically to change the frequency according to hopping pattern
  // ...
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and implementing secure communication is a complex task. In particular, the secure exchange of keys (in the `exchangeKeys` function) can be complex and should ideally be done with established cryptographic libraries and protocols.
